# Blockchain-Distributed-DevOps
This repository contains a dataset used to perform performance tests on a blockchain system for the research paper "Exploring the Integration of Blockchain and Distributed DevOps for Secure, Transparent, and Traceable Software Development". The dataset includes information on latency and size for 500 blocks, measured during the tests.

## Dataset Details
The dataset is stored in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format and contains the following columns:

1. **Block**: Represents the block number.
2. **Latency**: Indicates the time it took for a block to be added to the blockchain, measured in milliseconds.
3. **Size**: Represents the size of the block in the blockchain, measured in bytes.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the dataset and adapt it to suit your specific needs.
